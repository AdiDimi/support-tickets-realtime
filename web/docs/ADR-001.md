## ADR-001: Frontend Architecture and Key Decisions

### Context

We need a responsive, maintainable React frontend that consumes a .NET Core API and supports realtime ticket updates.

### Decision

- Use React 18 + TypeScript with Vite for fast DX and modern tooling.
- Use TanStack Query for fetching/caching/server-state and mutations.
- Use Axios as HTTP client with a simple base instance.
- Use SignalR for realtime events to invalidate cached ticket lists.
- Generate API types/client from Swagger using `openapi-typescript` and `orval`.

### Rationale

- TanStack Query provides excellent caching, mutation, and background refetch semantics, minimizing custom state.
- SignalR integrates natively with ASP.NET Core for reliable realtime events.
- OpenAPI-driven client ensures type-safety and reduces drift between FE/BE.

### Alternatives Considered

- Redux Toolkit Query: solid, but TanStack Query is framework-agnostic and already fits our caching needs.
- WebSockets via custom client: possible but SignalR simplifies reconnect/backoff and server integration.

### Consequences

- Frontend expects stable Swagger at `/swagger/v1/swagger.json` to generate clients.
- Realtime events are used to invalidate lists; optimistic updates can be added later for better UX.

### Follow-ups

- Introduce auth integration once backend provides endpoints.
- Replace mocked agent list with API endpoint.
